# Database Systems Project

This repository hosts the **semester project** of the Database Systems lecture series held by NTUA during the 6th semester (Spring 2020-2021) of the ECE undergraduate course. 
The project's goal was to design a database system and a web interface for an imaginary hotel (ASDF hotel). This hotel, in order to track potentially COVID-19 cases, has NFC enabled access to rooms and services,
so our job was to create a database and a web interface that can save and track the whereabouts of each client for tracking purposes.
